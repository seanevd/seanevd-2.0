                I’m Sean Duncan. I am a front-end developer who enjoys many
                aspects of product development, including product design and
                illustration. I currently enjoy having a 60/40 split in
                development and design, respectively. (I spend a majority of my
                time writing code.) I generally design abstract tools or
                workflows and put those designs into production code. I’ve
                worked with all sorts of tools including Angular, Meteor,
                React, jQuery, Gulp, Sass, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, and
                much more.

                I joined Nutrislice as the first front-end developer and
                subsequently their first designer as well. I always had a
                respect for good design but never had to advocate for it until
                I started there.

            <h2>
                Previously, I studied both Mechanical and Electrical
                engineering, but ended up with a business degree. I ultimately
                decided to follow my passion of web development and have never
                looked back.
