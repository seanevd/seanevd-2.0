            Super admin is the platform which unifies all of the Nutrislice services into one interface.  These services include Digital Signage, Enterprise Tools, Dashboard Analytics, and Taste Test Pro (with Menus coming summer of 2016).

            I started at Nutrislice when Super Admin was in its infancy. One of my first tasks with the company was to take some very early wireframes, intended as an admin for Digital Signage, and expand upon them. Creating a style guide to help pave the way for many products to come. I worked closely with both the CEO and CTO to create designs that allowed users to easily solve complex problems.
