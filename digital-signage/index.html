            Digital signage is a platform that displays lunch menus in the web browser on a large TV screen. There are several components within digital signage called content types that the user can select from to create their display. These include: various menus, weather api based on location, user uploaded images and videos, and customizable information banners.

            My role, as a member of the digital signage team, has been to design and build all of these content types from the ground up. The biggest challenge that we are facing on this project is supporting a variety of hardware from desktop computers to smart TVs. Another challenge associated with the design aspect of this project is creating responsive content both horizontally and vertically. Problem solving throughout the creation of this project has kept things interesting and exciting.
