            Nutrislice Meal Planner (Create-a-Meal) is a web application that allows students
            and parents the ability to plan out their meals for the week or
            month. Users are able to view nutritional information based on their
            daily caloric need and can see how a meal stacks up against the
            federal myPlate requirements. Users select their meals, then can
            save and print their individualized plan.

            I was given the task of designing the web app from the start.
            After several rounds of design critiques and feedback, a spec was
            nailed down. Immediately after design I built the tool alongside
            another develoer. I made the Nutrislice Meal planner as a fully
            responsive web app, it was incredibly difficult to reuse a majority
            of the elements for large and small screens sizes while maintaining
            a mobile app look and feel for the smaller screens.
