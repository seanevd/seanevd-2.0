            Nutrislice Meal Planner is a web application that allows students and parents the ability to plan out their meals for the week or month. Users are able to view nutritional information based on their daily caloric need and can see how a meal stacks up against the federal myPlate requirements. Users select their meals, then can save and print their individualized plan. I designed and developed Nutrislice Meal Planner as a fully responsive web application. This was challenging due to the complexity of displaying large amounts of content in different ways on different devices.
